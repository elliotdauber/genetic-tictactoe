### Genetic TicTacToe

Genetic Algorithm for playing the classic game Tic Tac Toe
Made out of interest after reading "Complexity" by Melanie Mitchell
Works but doesn't produce a very good Tic Tac Toe player yet

Steps:
make
To train a model, run ./train
To play against it, run ./play

To Do:
Make the model better
Add command line args
Speed up the algorithm (make it possible to run on boards larger than 4x4)
