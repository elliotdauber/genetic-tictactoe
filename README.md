### Genetic TicTacToe

Genetic Algorithm for playing the classic game Tic Tac Toe

Made out of interest after reading "Complexity" by Melanie Mitchell

Works but doesn't produce a very good Tic Tac Toe player yet

Steps:
<<<<<<< HEAD
make
To train a model, run ./train
To play against it, run ./play <filename>

To Do:
- Make the model better
- Add command line args
- Speed up the algorithm (make it possible to run on boards larger than 4x4)
- Make the PlayerBase and GameBase classes more useful, so you can just inherit and plug in some specific mechanics
